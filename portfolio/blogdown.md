## Description

[BlogDown](https://github.com/thingdown/blogdown) is a blazing fast front-end blogging platform anyone can use with a bit of markdown magic. In fact, this very website is built using [BlogDown](https://github.com/thingdown/blogdown). It supports custom themes, styles, modules, and taxonomies. BlogDown is unique in the aspect that it is back-end agnostic. It can run on any web back-end \([apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [node](https://nodejs.org), [python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html), etc . . .\) and can even function directly off of file servers.

## What I Learned

I gained a very solid grasp of Google's new front-end framework, [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/). The idea of web components is a concept that I thankful to have when I started learning React.  To this day, I greatly appreciate the encapsulation that componentized development brings to the world of front-end web development.  I definitely like my code DRY \(don't repeat yourself\).
